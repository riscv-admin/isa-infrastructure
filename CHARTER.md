The ISA Infrastructure HC is responsible for developing the strategy, identifying gaps, and overseeing all aspects of making the development and maintenance of the RISC-V ISA reliable, usable, and widely accessible.

This includes  (but not limited to):
- Developing the documentation processes and conventions enabling Task Groups to precisely explain the ISA in both prose and programmatic means.
- Defining testing techniques, frameworks, and standards for HW and SW that implement the ISA.
- Identifying and  ensuring that all three of Sail, Spike, and Qemu simulators have a roadmap and that Task groups are executing to that roadmap (this include gaps in the basic functionality of the simulators as appropriate).
- Defining the conventions and methodologies for defining the formal model in SAIL for extensions.
- Develop methods and facilities to ensure that we can do continuous integration and regression testing for both upstream project components and RISC-V only components of the ecosystem.
